                <p>Hi priyanka,</p>
                <p>Wish you a very happy birthday to you!</p>
                <p>I hope your day is as amazing as you are! I’m so glad I got to spend part of it with you—it made the trip worth it. You deserve all the love, laughter, and cake today. And honestly, after visiting, I couldn't help but think... how cool would it be if you moved to Bangalore? The weather’s great, the food’s even better, and it’d be way more fun having you around!</p>

                <p>Cant wait to catch up again—maybe next time in Bangalore?</p>
